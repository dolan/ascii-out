The purpose of this app is to convert images into ASCII Art

It runs in the browser (implemented in javascript)
It does not actually upload files to any file system, but rather processes them in RAM
It uses an existing javascript library to output image data as ASCII Art
It has two possible output formats
  1) Raw text. The output will be downloadable as an 80-column ASCII image
  2) PNG. The output will be downloadable as a PNG file that is an image of the rendered ASCII text.

When generating project files
- Use generation tools where necessary. Do not simulate their output (For example, use rails on the command line to generate a migration, do not simply generate the contents of a migration file)
- Use snake_case_naming_conventions
- One file per javascript class
- Automatically create a blank test file for every new class that is created
- Automatically comment the classes and all public methods

When creating and applying requested changes:
- do not change the existing algorithms unless the requested change explicitly asks for a change to the algorithm
- do not substitute code from a similar implementation for existing code unless explicitly requested by the user
- update any relevant comments that become out of date or add any that help illustrate the situation
